<b>Cinnamon Cinemas' Seat Placement Challenge</b><br>


Definitions and restrictions:<br>

This is Cinnamon Cinemas' assumption to develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theater.

Criteria and Assumptions:
The Cinema has 15 seats arranged in 3 rows of 5 each.
Lines A through C are assigned a letter.
Seats are assigned a number from 1 to 5.
Starting from seat A1, the program allocates seats according to a random integer “number of seats” from 1 to 3 of the available seats that fill the auditorium in order from left to right, front to back.

Implementation: <br>

The implementation of allocating all the seats available for sale when the program started and continued until the Cinema become full is represented by Modeling of class structure  by UML.

The solution was created with the Test Driven Development approach - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. Each commit in the Github repository contained unit tests that matched to the focus for each scenario.
